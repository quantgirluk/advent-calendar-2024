# Day 23: Inverse Gaussian Process

The Inverse Gaussian Process is a stochastic process whose increments follow the Inverse Gaussian distribution, a continuous probability distribution often used to model positive, skewed data. This process is widely applied in fields such as finance, reliability engineering, and queueing theory.

## Definition

An Inverse Gaussian process is a stochastic process $\{X(t),t\geq 0\}$ where:

- $X(0)=0$,

- The increments $X(t)−X(s)$ (for t>s) are independent and follow the [Inverse Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_Gaussian_distribution) with mean $\mu(t-s)$ and scale parameter $\eta$,

## 🔔 Random Facts 🔔

- This Inverse Gaussian distribution appears to have been first derived in 1900 by [Louis Bachelier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier) as the time a stock reaches a certain price for the first time. In 1915 it was used independently by [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) and [Marian v. Smoluchowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Smoluchowski) as the time to first passage of a Brownian motion. 

- The name inverse Gaussian was proposed by British medical physicist and statistician [Maurice Tweedie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Tweedie) in 1945

- In 1968, M. T. Wasan introduced the concept of the Inverse Gaussian process in his paper "On an Inverse Gaussian Process," published in the _Scandinavian Actuarial Journal_. Wasan's work laid the foundation for subsequent research into the Inverse Gaussian process, influencing studies in areas such as bivariate distributions and first-passage time distributions in stochastic processes.

- The Inverse Gaussian process is used in various fields to model cumulative or first-passage phenomena where skewed, positive increments are observed
