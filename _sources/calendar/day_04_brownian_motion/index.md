### Day 4: Brownian Motion

Brownian motionÂ or Brownian movement generally refers to the random motion ofÂ [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle)Â suspended in a medium (aÂ [liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid)Â or aÂ [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas)). It is named after the Scottish botanistÂ [Robert Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_\(botanist,_born_1773\)), who first described the phenomenon in 1827, while looking through a microscope atÂ [pollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen)Â of the plantÂ _[Clarkia pulchella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarkia_pulchella)_Â immersed in water. He saw something like this:

InÂ mathematics, Brownian motion is described by theÂ [Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process), a continuous-timeÂ [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) named after American computer scientist, mathematician, and philosopherÂ [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener). It is probably the most well-knownÂ [LÃ©vy processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_process)Â ([cÃ dlÃ g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g)Â stochastic processes withÂ [stationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_increments)Â [independent increments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_increments)) since occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics,Â [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy)Â andÂ [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics).

#### Definition

A standard (one dimensional) Wiener process (or Brownian motion) is a stochastic process $W =\{W(t), t\geq 0\},$ characterised by the following four properties:

1\. $W(0) = 0$

2\. $W(t)-W(s) \sim N(0, t-s),$ for any $0\leq s \leq t$

3\. $W$ has independent increments

4\. $W$ is almost surely continuous.

A standard dâˆ’dimensional Wiener process is a vector-valued stochastic process defined as

$$W(t) = (W_1(t) ,W_2(t), \cdots, W_d(t)), \qquad t\geq 0,$$  
whose components $W_i$ are independent, standard one-dimensional Wiener processes.

#### ðŸ”” Random Facts ðŸ””

- In 1905, Albert Einsteinâ€™s published _Investigations on the Theory of Brownian Movement_ a groundbreaking work that provided a deep theoretical explanation of Brownian motion. He developed a mathematical framework linking the seemingly random motion of particles to the kinetic theory of heat, thereby confirming the existence of atoms and molecules as physical entities. He derived an expression that related the diffusion coefficient of particles to measurable properties such as temperature, viscosity, and particle size, enabling experimental validation.

- In 1923,Â Norbert WienerÂ formally proved the existence of the Wiener process. Its mathematical framework indirectly influencedÂ Richard Feynmanâ€™s path integral formulationÂ of quantum mechanics. The Wiener process provides a probabilistic foundation for simulating quantum particle paths, as the sum over all possible paths in Feynman's formulation is conceptually akin to the summation over random Brownian trajectories.Â 

- The Wiener process can be constructed as theÂ [scaling limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_limit)Â of aÂ [Random Walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk). This is known asÂ Donsker's theorem. Check out my previous [post](https://quantgirl.blog/donsker-random-walk/) about this construction.

- Like the Random Walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixedÂ [neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_\(mathematics\))Â of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher.

- The Brownian motion, has significant applications in finance, tracing back to French mathematician [Louis Bachelierâ€™s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier) pioneering 1900 thesis,Â _[Theory of Speculation](https://www.investmenttheory.org/uploads/3/4/8/2/34825752/emhbachelier.pdf)_. Bachelier was the first to apply the mathematics of Brownian motion to model stock price movements, preceding Einsteinâ€™s formalisation of the phenomenon. His work introduced the concept of price fluctuations as a random walk, laying the foundation for modern financial mathematics. Today, the Wiener process is a key component of models like the Black-Scholes equation for option pricing and is used extensively to model asset prices, interest rates, and risk in stochastic calculus frameworks.
