# Day 23: Inverse Gaussian Process

TheÂ Inverse Gaussian ProcessÂ is a stochastic process whose increments follow theÂ Inverse Gaussian distribution, a continuous probability distribution often used to model positive, skewed data. This process is widely applied in fields such as finance, reliability engineering, and queueing theory.

## Definition

AnÂ Inverse Gaussian processÂ is a stochastic processÂ $\{X(t),t\geq 0\}$ where:

- $X(0)=0$,

- The incrementsÂ $X(t)âˆ’X(s)$Â (forÂ t>s) are independent and follow the [Inverse Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_Gaussian_distribution) with meanÂ $\mu(t-s)$ and scale parameterÂ $\eta$,

## ðŸ”” Random Facts ðŸ””

- This Inverse Gaussian distribution appears to have been first derived in 1900 byÂ [Louis Bachelier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier) as the time a stock reaches a certain price for the first time. In 1915 it was used independently byÂ [Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) andÂ [Marian v. Smoluchowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Smoluchowski)Â as the time to first passage of a Brownian motion.Â 

- The name inverse Gaussian was proposed by British medical physicist and statisticianÂ [Maurice Tweedie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Tweedie)Â in 1945

- In 1968, M. T. Wasan introduced the concept of theÂ Inverse Gaussian processÂ in his paper "On an Inverse Gaussian Process," published in theÂ _Scandinavian Actuarial Journal_. Wasan's work laid the foundation for subsequent research into the Inverse Gaussian process, influencing studies in areas such as bivariate distributions and first-passage time distributions in stochastic processes.

- The Inverse Gaussian process is used in various fields to model cumulative or first-passage phenomena where skewed, positive increments are observed
