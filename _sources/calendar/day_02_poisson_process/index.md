## Day 2: Poisson Process

InÂ [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) aÂ Poisson point processÂ (also known as:Â Poisson random measure,Â Poisson random point fieldÂ andÂ Poisson point field) is a type ofÂ mathematical objectÂ that consists ofÂ [points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_\(geometry\))Â randomly located on aÂ [mathematical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_\(mathematics\))Â with the essential feature that the points occur independently of one another.

At its core, a Poisson process describes events that occur independently and at a constant average rate over time or space. Itâ€™s your go-to tool when you're analysing rare events or random occurrences. There have been many applications of the Poisson process (defined on the real line) in an attempt to model seemingly random and independent events occurring. It has a fundamental role inÂ [queueing theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory), which is the probability field of developing suitable stochastic models to represent the random arrival and departure of certain phenomena. For example, customers arriving and being served or phone calls arriving at a phone exchange.

### Definition (on the real-line)

LetÂ $\lambda>0$Â be fixed. The counting processÂ $\{N(t), t\in [0, \infty)\}$Â is called aÂ Homogeneous Poisson process withÂ intensity/rateÂ Î»Â if all the following conditions hold:

- $N(0)=0$;Â 

- $N(t)$Â has independent increments;Â 

- The number of events (or arrivals) in any interval of lengthÂ $t$ is a Poisson random variable with parameter $\lambda t$. That is

$$Pr(N(t) = n) = \frac{(\lambda t)^n}{n!} e^{-\lambda t}$$

### ðŸ”” Random Facts ðŸ””

- Despite its name, the Poisson point process was neither discovered nor studied by French mathematicianÂ [Simeon Denis Poisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimÃ©on_Denis_Poisson)Â (1781â€“1840). It is cited as an example ofÂ [Stigler's law of eponymy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy) which Â states that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer!

- In 1903, [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_people)Â [actuary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary), andÂ [mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician)Â [Filip Lundberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filip_Lundberg)Â published a thesis containing work, now considered fundamental and pioneering, where he proposed to model insurance claims with a homogeneous Poisson process. However, it is believed that mathematician [William Feller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Feller) was the first in print to refer to it as theÂ _**Poisson process**_Â in his paper: [W. Feller. On the integro-diï¬€erential equations of purely discontinuous Markoï¬€ processes. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 48:488â€“515](https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1940-048-03/S0002-9947-1940-0002697-3/)

- InÂ finance, the Poisson process is widely used to model the occurrence of "rare" events, such as defaults, claims, or jumps in asset prices. For instance, inÂ credit risk modelling, it is employed to describe the likelihood of a borrower defaulting within a certain time frame, where the default is treated as a random, independent event.

- The Poisson process can also be defined by stating that the time differences between events of the counting process are exponential variables with mean $\frac{1}{\lambda}$. The time differences between the events or arrivals are known asÂ Â **interarrival**Â Â orÂ **interoccurence**Â times. This implies that the points have theÂ [memoryless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness)Â property: the existence of one point existing in a finite interval does not affect the probability (distribution) of other points existing, but this property has no natural equivalence when the Poisson process is defined on a space with higher dimensions.
