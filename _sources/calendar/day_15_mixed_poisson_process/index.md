## Day 15: Mixed Poisson Process

The Mixed Poisson Process (MPP) is an extension of the classical Homogeneous Poisson process that incorporates randomness into the rate parameter $\lambda$. In a standard homogeneous Poisson process, the rate parameterÂ $\lambda$Â is constant, and events occur independently over time or space. In contrast, a Mixed Poisson Process assumes $\lambda$Â is itself a random variable governed by a specified distribution.

### Definition (on the real-line)

A Mixed Poisson process (MPP) $\{N(t), t\in \[0, \infty)\}$Â is a counting process with counting distribution of the form:

$$P(N(t)= n) = \int\_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} e^{-\lambda t} (\lambda t)^n d \Lambda(\lambda), \qquad n\in \mathbb{N},$$

where $\Lambda$ is the structure distribution given by $\Lambda(\lambda) = P(\Lambda \leq \lambda)$ with $\Lambda(0)=0$. This type of distribution is known as mixed Poisson distribution which gives the name to the processes.

Note that if $\Lambda$ has density function $g$, we have

$$P(N(t)= n) = \int\_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} e^{-\lambda t} (\lambda t)^n g(\lambda) d\lambda, \qquad n\in \mathbb{N}.$$

Thus, given $\Lambda = \lambda$, $N(t)$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameterÂ $\lambda t$, i.e.:

$$P\left(N(t)= n| \Lambda=\lambda\right) = \frac{1}{n!} e^{-\lambda t} (\lambda t)^n, \qquad n\in\mathbb{N}.$$

### ðŸ”” Random Facts ðŸ””

- Mixed Poisson processes were first introduced in 1938 by French mathematician J. Dubourdieu, who wanted to describe the number of claims, in fixed periods, occurring in sickness and accident insurance

- If the intensity random variable $\Lambda$ is degenerate at a constant $\lambda$ ($\lambda > 0$), then we have the Homogeneous Poisson process. This is the only MPP that is simultaneously a renewal process.

- If the intensity random variable $\Lambda$ follows a Gamma distribution, then the resulting counting process $N(t)$ follows a Pascal or negative Binomial distribution. This case is known as the Pascal or Polya process.

- The Mixed Poisson Process is a specific case of aÂ Cox Process, also known as aÂ _doubly stochastic Poisson process_. The Cox process generalises the Poisson process even further by allowing the intensity/rate to vary over time according to an underlying stochastic process
