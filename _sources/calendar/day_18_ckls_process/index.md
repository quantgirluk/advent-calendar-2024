## Day 18: CKLS Process

TheÂ Chanâ€“Karolyiâ€“Longstaffâ€“Sanders (CKLS) processÂ is a stochastic model widely used in financial mathematics to describe the dynamics of interest rates. It generalizes existing models by incorporating a flexible functional form for volatility, allowing better alignment with observed market behaviors. Below, we explore its definition, historical origins, mathematical properties, and applications.

### Definition

The Chanâ€“Karolyiâ€“Longstaffâ€“Sanders (CKLS) model describes a process whose dynamics evolve according to the following Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)

$$dX\_t = (\alpha + \beta X\_t) dt + \sigma X\_t^{\gamma} dW\_t, \quad t >0,$$

with initial condition $X\_0 =x\_0in\mathbb{R}$; where $W\_t$ is a standard Brownian motion, and the four parameters are constants.

### ðŸ”” Random Facts ðŸ””

- The CKLS model was introduced in a 1992 paper byÂ Louis Chan, G. Andrew Karolyi, Francis Longstaff, and Anthony SandersÂ in theÂ _Journal of Finance_. The authors proposed the model to address limitations in traditional interest rate models, particularly their restrictive volatility structures.

- The CKLS stochastic differential equationÂ defines a broad class of interest rate processes which includes many well-known interest rate models. These models can be obtained from the SDE by simply placing the appropriate restrictions on the four parameters

- For $\gamma>0$ the process can be parameterised to ensureÂ itâ€‹Â remains non-negative, a desirable property for modelling interest rates.

- By encompassing popular models (e.g., Vasicek, CIR), CKLS facilitates model comparison and parameter testing
