# Day 21: Variance Gamma Process

In the theory of [stochastic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) the Variance Gamma(VG) process, also known as Laplace motion or Madan-Seneta process, is a [Lévy process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_process) determined by a random time change.

## Definition

There are several representations of the Variance-Gamma process that relate it to other processes. It can for example be written as a [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process) $W$ with drift $\theta t$ subjected to a random time change which follows a [gamma process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_process) $\Gamma(t;1,\nu)$, i.e.:

$$X(t; \sigma, \nu, \theta) = \theta \Gamma(t;1, \nu) + \sigma W(\Gamma(t;1, \nu)); \quad t\geq 0.$$

There is no [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion) component in the VG process and it is thus a [pure jump process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_jump_process). The increments are independent and follow a [variance-gamma distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance-gamma_distribution), which is a generalisation of the [Laplace distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution).

## 🔔 Random Facts 🔔

- The Variance-Gamma process was introduced by mathematicians Dilip Madan and Eugene Senet**a** in 1990 as a model for stock price returns. They aimed to address the deficiencies of the Black-Scholes model, which assumes normally distributed returns, by introducing skewness and excess kurtosis into the framework.

- Madan and Seneta initially presented the case of symmetric distributed increments ($\theta=0$), which was extended to incorporate skewness ($\theta\in\mathbb{R}$) by Madan, Carr and Chang who extended the model to allow for an asymmetric form and present a formula to price [European options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_option) under the variance gamma process.

- The Variance-Gamma process builds on earlier work on Lévy processes and time-changed Brownian motions. It became popular in financial modelling due to its ability to fit empirical return distributions better than traditional Gaussian models.

- The Variance-Gamma process has finite moments, distinguishing it from many Lévy processes.

- The VG process can be advantageous to use when pricing options since it allows for a wider modeling of [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) and [kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) than the [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) does. As such the variance gamma model allows to consistently price options with different strikes and maturities using a single set of parameters.
