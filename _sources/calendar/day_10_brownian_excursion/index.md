### Day 10 : Brownian Excursion

A Brownian excursion is yet another stochastic process which arises from a Weiner process (standard Brownian motion) with the additional condition that it stays positive over a given interval and ends at zero. It is particularly significant in probability theory, combinatorics, and applications like queuing theory and random geometry.

#### Definition

A normalised Brownian excursion is a nonnegative real-valued stochastic proces**s** $X$ defined on the interval $\[0,1\]$ which can be constructed from a standard Brownian motion $W$ on $\[0,T\]$ by conditioning on it being nonnegative on $(0,T)$ and equal to zero at the end time. Alternatively, it is a [Brownian bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_bridge) process conditioned to be positive.

We can obtain a Brownian Excursion from a Brownian Bridge path by using the so called Vervaat construction. Let $\tau\_m$ be the time at which a Brownian Bridge process $W\_b$ achieves its minimum on $\[0, 1\]$. Vervaat (1979) shows that the process defined as:

$$\{W\_b(\tau\_m + t \mod 1) - W\_b(\tau\_m), \quad 0\leq t\leq 1 \},$$

is a Brownian excursion.

#### 🔔 Random Facts 🔔

- Brownian Excursions are deeply connected to combinatorial structures, particularly random trees and [Catalan numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number). See [https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL14/Whitt/whitt6.pdf](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL14/Whitt/whitt6.pdf)

- In polymer physics, the shape of a polymer chain confined to a half-plane (or subject to some spatial constraint) can be modeled by a Brownian Excursion.

- If $X(t)$ is a Brownian excursion then so is $\tilde{X}(t) = X(1-t)$.
