Advent Calendar Stochastic Processes
====================================

In 2024, I used the countdown to Christmas ðŸŽ„ to explore the re-visit the world of `stochastic processes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution>`_.
Each day, we unwrapped a different distribution --exploring its shape, story, and where it appears in the real world.
